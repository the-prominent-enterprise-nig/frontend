# Scenario 07 — Repair Transfer — Gap Analysis & Closing Plan

- [86d3d19k6](https://app.clickup.com/t/86d3d19k6) — "AA Stock Controller, ISBAT raise a Repair Transfer that auto-creates the paired stock transfer to main, with the RFS form attached as supporting document" — _Sprint 3, to do_ — direct match to steps 1-2, worded almost identically
- [86d3d19pu](https://app.clickup.com/t/86d3d19pu) — "AA Warehouse Manager, ISBAT receive a Repair Transfer at main, assess it as repairable or unrepairable, and route it via Delivery Receipt or a manual write-off decision" — _Sprint 3, to do_ — direct match to step 3, including the "manual decision, no auto-junk" nuance this doc's Closing Gap 4 flags as needing a product decision. **Note**: this ticket still says "write-off decision" even though the write-off feature was removed from the codebase — same discrepancy flagged in Scenario 05/10, reconcile before implementing.
- [86d3phfw4](https://app.clickup.com/t/86d3phfw4) / [86d3phfux](https://app.clickup.com/t/86d3phfux) / [86d3phfuk](https://app.clickup.com/t/86d3phfuk) — "ISBAT have a unit returned through POS route to repair when it's marked as damaged" (Business Owner / Branch Manager / Warehouse Manager) — _Sprint 3, for qa_ — this is the POS-return-to-repair flagging already confirmed working in this doc's "What's already done" (via UDS), not the Repair Transfer entity itself.

Both core steps (raise the transfer, assess and decide at main) have direct tickets — the gap is between what those tickets ask for and what currently exists in code, not a missing-ticket problem.

## The scenario we're building toward

A sold or stock unit is found defective and needs service:

1. Raise a Repair Transfer; an RFS form is attached as the supporting document.
2. Transfer to main branch for assessment (auto-paired stock transfer); main issues the RR, no approval.
3. Assess & decide — repairable units go DR to the repair provider; unrepairable units need a manual decision (no auto-junk), then a write-off.

## What's already done ✅

**Nothing directly.** No matches for "Repair Transfer," "RFS," or "repair provider" anywhere in either codebase. One adjacent building block exists:

- **UDS (Unit Document Sheet)** — `backend/src/inventory/services/uds.service.ts`, `backend/src/inventory/controllers/uds.controller.ts`, model `UnitDocumentSheet`/`UnitDocumentSheetLine` (`backend/prisma/schema.prisma:4297-4327`). Its `UdsReason` enum already includes `repair` and `pull_out` (`schema.prisma:2280-2286`), with a status flow `issued → in_transit → received → completed/cancelled` (`:2288-2294`). The controller's own doc comment says "Issue a Unit Document Sheet for repair or pull-out" (`uds.controller.ts:32`) — this was clearly built with something like Repair Transfer in mind, but it's a documentation/tracking artifact only: no RFS-form field, no linkage to an actual stock transfer, no DR/debit entry to an external provider, no approval logic.
- The general **Inter-branch Transfer mechanism** (`backend/src/inventory/services/transfers.service.ts`, `StockTransfer` model — see scenario 06) is the natural engine for "moves to main branch," but has no auto-pairing to a UDS and no branch-specific no-approval-required path.
- The general **Receiving Report** mechanism (`stock.service.ts`) exists but nothing wires it to a repair-transfer receipt.

## What's not done / gaps ❌⚠️

1. No "Repair Transfer" entity or workflow at all — only the adjacent UDS artifact.
2. No RFS-form attachment concept.
3. No auto-pairing between a Repair Transfer and an actual stock transfer to the main branch.
4. No "main branch issues RR with no approval" special-cased receiving path.
5. No DR/debit-to-repair-provider concept, and no external repair-provider entity anywhere in the schema.
6. **No write-off mechanism exists at all to hang final disposal on.** A dedicated write-off feature (route, service methods, DTOs, permissions, UI, dashboard tiles) was fully removed in commits `96334e6` and `de5b0d8`. Only the generic `createAdjustment()` (`backend/src/inventory/services/adjustments.service.ts`) remains, used today for stock-count discrepancy reconciliation — it has no supplier/provider linkage, no photo evidence, no dedicated approval flow. The "manual decision, no auto-junk, then write-off" step in the scenario has nowhere to land.

## Closing the gaps

This is a net-new workflow. Sequence matters — later steps depend on earlier entities existing.

### 1. Decide how "Repair Transfer" relates to UDS — extend, don't duplicate

**Problem**: UDS already models "issue a document for a repair-bound unit" with the right reason code and status flow, but nothing else about the scenario.
**Fix**: extend `UnitDocumentSheet` rather than building a parallel entity — add an `rfsFormUrl`/attachment field, a `linkedStockTransferId` (nullable FK to `StockTransfer`), and a `repairProviderId` (new lightweight entity, or reuse `Supplier` if repair providers are effectively vendors in this business). This keeps one document type for "unit is moving for a repair/pull-out reason" instead of two overlapping ones.

### 2. Auto-pair the stock transfer to main branch

**Problem**: no linkage between issuing a repair document and moving the physical unit.
**Fix**: on UDS creation with `reason: repair`, auto-create a `StockTransfer` to the tenant's main/head branch (needs a "main branch" concept — check if one exists on `Branch`/`BusinessSettings`; if not, add a simple `isMainBranch` flag), and set `UnitDocumentSheet.linkedStockTransferId` from #1.

### 3. No-approval receiving at main branch

**Problem**: normal transfers (post-scenario-06 changes) may gain approval gating; repair transfers should bypass that.
**Fix**: either exempt `reason: repair`-originated transfers from the scenario-06 approval toggle, or keep repair transfers on the plain `transfers.service.ts` `dispatch`/`receive` path entirely separate from scenario 06's new request/approval flow.

### 4. Decide the write-off replacement before building "unrepairable → write-off"

**Problem**: write-offs were deliberately removed; re-adding the old feature verbatim would undo that decision without knowing why it was removed.
**Fix**: **don't silently rebuild write-offs.** First confirm with the business/whoever made the removal decision whether disposal-of-unrepairable-units genuinely needs its own dedicated flow (photo evidence, approval, GL posting to a loss/scrap account) or whether the generic `createAdjustment()` (`reasonCode: write_off` already exists in `AdjustmentReasonCode`) is an intentionally lighter-weight replacement that should just get a UI. This is a product decision, not a pure engineering one — flag it before implementing.

### 5. DR to repair provider

**Problem**: no external repair-provider entity or debit-entry concept exists.
**Fix**: depends on #1's `repairProviderId` decision (new entity vs. reusing `Supplier`). If reusing `Supplier`, the debit entry can likely reuse the existing AP-bill posting pattern (scenario 10); if a genuinely new "service provider" concept, it needs its own lightweight AP-adjacent posting.

## Dead code / unused-feature flags

- **UDS's `repair`/`pull_out` reason codes** — not dead, but currently under-built relative to what their own doc comment implies they're for. Not a delete candidate; a build-out candidate per Closing Gap 1.
